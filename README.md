The starter code for your Assignment 2 coding submission.

# Getting Started

You will likely need to install some Python library dependencies. We recommend starting from a somewhat recent and clean Python environment. We have tested on:
- Python 3.13.11 on Ubuntu via latest miniconda
- Python 3.13.11 on Mac via latest miniconda
- Python 3.8.10 native install
